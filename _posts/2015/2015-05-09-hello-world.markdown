Hi all!

I started to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) based blogging system. Nothing fancy here yet. I normally use [my other website](http://kehribar.me) for releasing finished projects but I'll use this blog to release some unpolished prototypes.

Theme definitely needs a change, but done is better than perfect. I'll probably tweak with the look of this site soon.

I'm using [Github](https://github.com) for hosting, and [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for entries. I would normally used [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), but [Jekyll plugin](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer) of the Atom worked better.

I'll also leave this post with an image of Jim Williams’ “Living room thermometer”. Because, why not.

ihsan.
